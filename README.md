UwUCore!

Primarily made for a server network of mine: Daunted, a little plugin consisting of core featues that are to be on each sub-server.

<br/>**Discalimer:**<br/>
This is **not** intended for production use, expect a severe lack of configurability and a lot of pre-defined values which may not fit every server's use case.

I've decided to open source it if anyone wants to take a look at some certain commands/features in particular, or use it for like a dev environment if you don't really care about what was mentioned prior. Or you could take it and skid it all with your own changes like the fat meanie you are.
